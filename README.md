### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Austin Pringle** (yes, _Pringle_, like the potato chips! No relation.). 

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science Degree in **Computer Information Systems**, with a minor in **Computer Science** at Pennsylvania Western University, California. I enjoy tinkering with self-hosted applications and building small projects on my own.

I enjoy building efficient and automated systems that make life better for the people that use them. I have experience in several areas of computer systems, including programming, system administraion, and DevOps. I take a particular intrest in Linux and Open Source!
