### Hello!

My name is **Austin Pringle**. (Yes, _Pringle_, like the popular potato chips!)

I attend Pennsylvania Western Universty, California and I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Systems, with minor in Computer Science.

## Some Things About Me

🛠️ I love tinkering around by self-hosting web services and writing small applications.

🐧 I live and breathe free-and-open-source software.

👣 I contribute to the [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME) software ecosystem. [See my contributions and projects here.](https://gitlab.gnome.org/arpringle)
