### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Austin Pringle** (yes, _Pringle_, like the popular potato chips! No, I'm not relatedâ€”just a fun coincidence! ðŸ˜„). 

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Information Systems**, with a minor in **Computer Science** at **Pennsylvania Western University, California**. I enjoy tinkering with self-hosted applications and building small projects on my own.

I have hands-on experience in software development, thanks to my CS minor and contributions to open-source projects. On the other side, my CIS major has helped me gain solid experience in software deployment, including managing and deploying applications in personal projects.
