### Hello!

My name is **Austin Pringle**. (Yes, _Pringle_, like the popular potato chips! Before you ask, I'm not related, haha!)

I attend Pennsylvania Western Universty, California and I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Systems, with minor in Computer Science. I love tinkering around by self-hosting various applications, and also writing small applications myself.

I have experience in the software development side of tech, via my CS minor and my research/contributions into open-source projects. I also have experience on the software-deployment side of tech via my CIS major and my personal experience deploying certian apps.

To see some examples of my projects, you can visit my personal portfolio website over at [https://austinpringle.com]!
